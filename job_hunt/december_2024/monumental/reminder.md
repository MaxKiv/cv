Dear Dominic,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly follow up on my
application for the Control Software Engineer position at Monumental, which I
submitted on December 31, 2024.

I understand that your Chief of Staff was on leave during the holidays, and I
truly appreciate your time and consideration during what is likely a busy period
for your team. I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to
Monumental's mission and am happy to provide any additional information or
clarify anything that might assist in the application process.

Thank you again for your time and for keeping me updated. I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Max Kivits
