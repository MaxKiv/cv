Dear Dominic,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my
application for the Control Software Engineer position at Monumental, which I
submitted on December 31, 2024. Have you gotten a chance to look at it?

I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Monumental's
mission and am happy to provide any additional information that might assist in
the application process.

Thank you for your time and for keeping me updated. I look forward to
hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Max Kivits
