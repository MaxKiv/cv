Dear Dominic,

I wanted to follow up on my application for the Control Software Engineer position at Monumental, which I submitted on the first of January. Since it has been long I assumed you are looking at other candidates, but I wanted to check to be sure.

I remain enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Monumental's mission and am happy to provide any additional information that might assist in the application process.

Thank you for your time and for keeping me updated. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Max Kivits
