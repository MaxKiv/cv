**Subject:** Application for the Control Software Engineer Position  

Dear Dominic Hurst,


I am excited to apply for the Control Software Engineer role at Monumental. My ideal job is a robotics startup using the latest technology to work towards positive societal change. Monumental fits this image better than any other company in the Netherlands, so you can imagine how thrilled I was when I found out you currently have open positions!

I love working on problems that cross disciplines, as evidenced by my studies, personal projects and varied professional experience. During my Thesis, I worked on controlling a heterogeneous group of generic multirotor UAVs using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control to cooperatively estimate the state of a target object using a Kalman filter. Within 6 months I was able to dive into this state-of-the-art control theory, understand the existing frameworks, collaborate to turn ideas into the movement of real physical systems and present my findings to a varied audience.

I like to be dropped into new projects and figure out how everything connects. The connection between hardware and software is especially interesting to me. During my time as Embedded Software Developer at Bosch, I worked on various aspects of a boiler firmware stack. I enjoyed promoting collaboration and reuse by using modern C++ features where they made sense, and removing them where they did not.

My desire to learn translates into various personal projects. I am exploring Async Rust on multiple embedded platforms interfacing with various sensors and actuators as a stepping stone toward a fully self-designed aeroponics setup. I use Nix to manage the tooling for my projects and configure my system.  I designed a pcb and casing for my custom split keyboard running qmk. 

For me, Monumental has it all. A clear mission statement aiming for positive societal impact. A fully in-house state-of-the-art robotics stack and hardware lab. An early-stage startup with an aggressive focus on learning and innovation, and a diverse group of experts to collaborate with and learn from. 

I sincerely hope you will consider me for this role, I would love to be part of this mission and believe I can contribute meaningfully!


Sincerely,

Max Kivits
