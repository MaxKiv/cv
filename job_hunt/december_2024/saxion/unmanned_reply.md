# Me
Dear Marina Pril - Schuppener,

Thanks for inviting me for an interview, that's so awesome!

Unfortunately I will not be able to attend physically, as I'm currently
travelling through New Zealand. I hope it is no problem to conduct any
interviews online until I return to the Netherlands this March.

Looking forward to next week!

Best regards,

Max Kivits
