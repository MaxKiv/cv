Hi Joshua Slater,

First of all: Happy New Year!

I'm writing to request a short meeting about the open DevOps position at Q*Bird.

I would prefer my next job to be in a start-up environment, one that has a clear mission statement aiming for societal impact and a modern tech stack (especially Rust). Naturally, Q*Bird caught and retained my interest, ever since I learned of the company through your colleague and our mutual friend, Pieter Staal.

I asked Pieter to check if Q*Bird has anything that matches my profile. Sadly he told me you are currently not looking for more embedded engineers and that the software engineering position requires more seniority. Fortunately, you do have an open DevOps position. 

I have attached my CV. I realise I might not be the best fit for this role. However, I have experience working with complex systems, Git, CI/CD pipelines, software deployment on custom hardware and some of the core technologies. The vacancy mentions building development tools and infrastructure, which closely relates to my interests in Rust and Nix. I am extremely motivated to learn about new technologies and become a better engineer, something I feel Q*Bird provides ample opportunity to do.

To me, the most important part of a position is the working environment, and Q*Bird offers one where I could thrive and be happy. A young and diverse team of international experts open to collaborate with and learn from. A clear mission statement aiming to better the world we live in. An opportunity to work on exciting next-gen technology. For me, Q*Bird ticks all the boxes.

I'm interested to learn more about the position to decide whether it is a good fit. If you feel my profile matches what you are looking for, I would gladly explain my experience and motivation in a digital meeting.

As I'm currently abroad, I'm looking for a position when I relocate back to the Netherlands around April 2025. My current timezone is NZDT (GMT+13), so CET morning would probably be the best time for a call.

Best regards,

Max Kivits
