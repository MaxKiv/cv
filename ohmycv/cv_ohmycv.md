## **Summary**

I am a dedicated robotics engineer with a passion for working in diverse teams that foster a growth mindset. My goal is to further my expertise in robotics, embedded systems, control theory, and software engineering, contributing to innovative and impactful projects.

## **Work Experience**

#### **Embedded Software Engineer**  
**Engineero**  
*October 2022 - April 2024*

- Developed a C# GUI desktop application and C firmware for laser power supplies.
- Seconded to R&D Nefit Bosch, Deventer for 13 months.
  - Worked on C++ firmware for Boiler Control Units running EmbOS.
  - Developed hardware drivers, communication stacks, business logic.
  - Improved error handling and contributed to an x86 Windows firmware simulator.

#### **Robotics Developer**  
**Teqram**  
*January 2022 - September 2022*

- Developed algorithms for ABB IRB 7600 to pick metal parts using magnetic grippers, utilizing C++ and Lua.
- Created a C++/Lua UDP server for tracking products through a factory.
- Built a Java-based Android app to interface with the server.
- Extended legacy C++ CRM, quoting, and management software using the QT4 framework.

#### **Control Engineer Intern**  
**Corvus Drones**  
*2020*

- Worked on the landing procedure of a greenhouse monitoring UAV and its
pathfinding using IMU and VIO.
- Utilized C++ and ROS1 for development.

## **Education**

#### **Master of Science in Electrical Engineering**  
**University of Twente**  
*2019 - 2022*  
- **Specialisation**: Robotics and Mechatronics  
- **Thesis**: Researched and developed a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller to control a group of heterogeneous UAVs to collaboratively estimate the state of a target object. The controller is built on the Genome framework in C++ and Python. The controller uses a model that captures the full nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs and outputs low-level actuator inputs for each of the UAV rotors.
