### **Education**

#### **Master of Science in Electrical Engineering**  
**University of Twente**  
*2019 - 2022*  
- **Specialisation**: Robotics and Mechatronics  
- **Thesis**: Researched and developed a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller to control a group of heterogeneous UAVs to collaboratively estimate the state of a target object. The controller is built on the Genome framework in C++ and Python. The controller uses a model that captures the full nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs and outputs low-level actuator inputs for each of the UAV rotors. [RAL Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9682606)  
- **Subjects**: Modern Robotics, Optimal, Robust & Nonlinear Control Theory, Machine Learning and Computer Vision, Python & C++ Programming

#### **Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering**  
**University of Twente**  
*2014 - 2018*  
- **Thesis**: Machine Learning - CNN for early stage melanoma detection using data augmentation and transfer learning, built in MATLAB  
- **Subjects**: Circuit Analysis, Signal Processing, Control Theory
