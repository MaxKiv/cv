## **Summary**

Robotics engineer with expertise in embedded systems, control theory, and
software engineering. Passionate about collaborative, growth-oriented teams and
developing innovative robotics to solve problems that matter.

## **Work Experience**
#### Embedded Software Engineer - Nefit Bosch Deventer (2022 - 2024)


- Developed cross-platform C++17 Cortex-M4 firmware (STM, Renesas) for custom hardware using the EmbOS RTOS.
- Built and maintained drivers for GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C, and the LIN and CAN stacks.
- Desgined custom firmware and hardware for integration testing on a Jenkins-based CI/CD server
- Contributed to a Windows firmware simulator leveraging an x86 EmbOS simulation library for Systemtesting.
- Centralized development efforts by reconciling multiple git repository forks and promoting code quality through reviews and pair programming.
- Expanded the Linux/WSL dev tooling and CMake build scripts

#### Embedded Software Consultant - SFC Energy Almelo (2022)  

- Developed a C# library implementing a custom serial communication protocol to interface with industrial power supply units
- Worked on a C#11 .NET MAUI GUI application which uses above library to greatly reduce power supply configuration time in production

#### Embedded Software Engineer - Engineero (2022 - 2024)

- Researched and presented the advantages of using modern C++ over C for firmware development

#### Robotics Developer - Teqram (2022)
- Developed and maintained software for an ABB IRB 7600 to automate metal part handling with magnetic grippers, utilizing C++ and Lua.
- Improved factory inventory tracking by building a Java Android app for barcode scanners that communicate with C++/Lua UDP server.
- Extended legacy C++ CRM, quoting, and management software using the QT4 framework.

#### **Control Engineer Intern**  
**Corvus Drones**  
*2020*

- Worked on the landing procedure of a greenhouse monitoring UAV and its pathfinding using VIO.
- Utilized C++, ROS1 and python for development.

## **Education**

#### Master of Science in Electrical Engineering 

**University of Twente**  
*2019 - 2022*  
- **Specialisation**: Robotics and Mechatronics  
- **Thesis**: Researched and developed a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller to control a group of heterogeneous UAVs to collaboratively estimate the state of a target object. The controller is built on the Genome framework in C++ and Python. The controller uses a model that captures the full nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs and outputs low-level actuator inputs for each of the UAV rotors. [RAL Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9682606)  
- **Subjects**: Modern Robotics, Optimal, Robust & Nonlinear Control Theory, Machine Learning and Computer Vision, Python & C++ Programming

#### **Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering**  
**University of Twente**  
*2014 - 2018*  
- **Thesis**: Machine Learning - CNN for early stage melanoma detection using data augmentation and transfer learning, built in MATLAB  
- **Subjects**: Circuit Analysis, Signal Processing, Control Theory
