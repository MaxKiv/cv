## Summary

Robotics engineer with expertise in embedded systems, control theory, and
software engineering. Passionate about collaborative, growth-oriented teams and
developing innovative robotics to solve problems that matter. Enthusiastic about
leveraging modern tools like embedded Rust and Nix. Driven to continuously
learn.


## Work Experience
#### (2022-2024) Embedded Software Engineer - Nefit Bosch Deventer 

- Developed cross-platform C++17 firmware (STM, Renesas) for Cortex-M4 hardware using the EmbOS RTOS.
- Built and maintained drivers for GPIO, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C, and the LIN and CAN stacks.
- Designed custom firmware and hardware for integration testing on a Jenkins-based CI/CD server
- Contributed to a Windows firmware simulator leveraging an x86 EmbOS simulation library for Systemtesting.
- Centralized development efforts by reconciling multiple git repository forks and promoting code quality through reviews and pair programming.
- Expanded the Linux/WSL dev tooling and CMake build scripts

#### (2022) Embedded Software Consultant - SFC Energy Almelo   

- Developed a C# library implementing a custom serial communication protocol to interface with industrial power supply units
- Worked on a C#11 .NET MAUI GUI application which uses above library to greatly reduce power supply configuration time in production

#### (2022-2024) Embedded Software Engineer - Engineero 

- Researched and presented the advantages of using modern C++ over C for firmware development

#### (2022) Robotics Developer - Teqram 
- Developed and maintained software for an ABB IRB 7600 to automate metal part handling with magnetic grippers, utilizing C++ and Lua.
- Improved factory inventory tracking by building a Java Android app for barcode scanners that communicate with C++/Lua UDP server.
- Extended legacy C++ CRM, quoting, and management software using the QT4 framework.

#### (2020) Control Engineer Internship - Corvus Drones 

- Developed the landing procedure for an autonomous greenhouse monitoring UAV using VIO.
- Worked on the path finding and sensor fusion software using C++ and ROS1.


## Education

#### (2019-2022) Msc Electrical Engineering - University of Twente 
- **Specialisation**: Robotics and Mechatronics  
- **Thesis**: Researched and worked on a state of the art Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller
to control a group of heterogeneous UAVs to collaboratively measure the state of a target object using an Extended Kalman filter. The controller is built on the Genome framework in C++ and Python. The controller uses a model that captures the full nonlinear dynamics of the UAVs and outputs low-level actuator inputs for each of the UAV rotors.

- **Subjects**: Modern Robotics, Optimal, Robust & Nonlinear Control Theory,
Machine Learning and Computer Vision, C++, Python

#### (2014-2018) Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering  - University of Twente 
- **Thesis**: Machine Learning - CNN for early stage melanoma detection using data augmentation and transfer learning, built in MATLAB  
- **Subjects**: Circuit Analysis, Signal Processing, Control Theory
